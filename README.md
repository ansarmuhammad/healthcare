Initial Prompt to Jules.google.com


Use my github repo to upload the data and code: https://github.com/ansarmuhammad/healthcare
Please upload all data and code to this repo without asking, just do it as soon as a you finish a task


I need you to please create for me the following datasets in csv format for an inpatient hospital scenarios and focus on the inpatient billing system

1. Patient record (assumption is that the patient has been discharged)
2. Patient visit record (specially mention the discharge_date, start_date_of_inpatient_visit, room_type, etc.)
3. Charge which mentions the service_code, charge_amount, patient_visit, charge_date, charge_transfer_date_from_lab
4. Create charge data above such that 100% of the charges are on or before discharge_date for 90% of the patients
5. For late_charges which are those charges which are posted after the patient discharge_date, mention the charge_transfer_date_from_lab as a date after discharge_date of the patient
6. Generate record for atleast 100 patients
7. Generate atleast 100 charges for each patient

******************* JULES MADE SOME ERRORS INITIALLY BUT AFTER A FEW MINOR PROMPTS I HAD MY DATA ************************************************

Next prompt is below

awesome, good job. now can you now use all the files above to find out what is wrong with the process

what can lead to bad debt and losses

write a new program that achieves this in a repeatable way using all the data you generated

the program should clearly output

which approach it took
mention the machine learning algorithm it used
mention what it found
mention how to fix it

************************** MY THIRD IMPORTANT PROMPT ********************************

update the dataset you produced: patients, patient visits, charges

have following scenarios added for atleast 100% of the data set. you can increase the data set

1. one service to dominate the late charges, so 25% of all late charges should belong to a service

2. add services from pharmacy and radiology as well, all previous services will belong to lab

3. show that late charges mostly come from lab but some do also come from pharmacy and radiology

4. show that bad debt cases also come due to following cases
4.1 length of stay more than 10 days
4.2 age of person more than 70 years
4.3 due to certain service charges mostly coming in late
4.4 due to certain type of ailment, show that if someone has cancer then it can be a source of higher bad debt
4.5 add some other cases of bad debt as well

******************* Fourth prompt ***********************************************************

now give me a fresh program that would analyze all this data and come up with reasons for bad debt.  it should also give ordered list of reasons and give some probability for each reason
